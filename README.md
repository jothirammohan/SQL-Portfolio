<h1>SQL Portfolio</h1>

- Designed and executed comprehensive data analyses, showcasing my expertise in database management and informatics.
- Effectively employed SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and transform large datasets, implementing complex queries and aggregations to extract valuable insights.
- Leveraged various SQL concepts:
  - **Queries**: Crafting complex queries using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.
  - **Data Modeling**: Database schemas, defined tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and established relationships between tables to ensure efficient data organization.
  - **Joins**: Proficient in various JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to merge and correlate data from multiple tables effectively.
  - **Subqueries**: Skilled at utilizing subqueries to extract and utilize data from one query within another, enabling in-depth data exploration.
  - **Aggregations**: Proficiency in using aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN) to summarize and analyze data comprehensively.
  - **Indexing**: Knowledgeable about database indexing techniques to optimize query performance and enhance data retrieval.
  - **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Skilled in extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into databases for analysis.
  - **Reporting and Visualization**: I've leveraged SQL alongside reporting tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to create dynamic reports and visualizations, making data insights accessible.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Highlighted Projects:</h2>

- **Spotify Top Songs Analysis**:
  - In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.

- **Spotify Top Songs Analaysis**:
  - Predictive Book Ratings Analysis - SQL: In this project, I used my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads. I categorized the books by genre and obtained the average difference in rating per genre. I created another table containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict, for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.
